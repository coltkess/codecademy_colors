# codecademy_colors
I'm a creature of habit who got started with Python through Codecademy. 
So when I started using PyCharm, I wanted the experience to be as similar as possible 
to what I knew -- font, colors, etc. 

This repository contains the .icls and .jar files I made to make PyCharm look like scripty.py. 
Feel free to tweak as you see fit!
